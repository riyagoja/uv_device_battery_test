# Python Script Controlling a Keysight N6705C DC Power Analyzer

This is a python script controlling a Keysight N6705 DC Power Analyzer to automate testing on a battery.
It compiles data on the voltage, current, and the percentage the fuel gauge is claiming versus the actual percentage.
I integrated commands found in the user guide of the power analyzer: https://www.batronix.com/files/Keysight/Leistungsanalysator/N6705-Manual.pdf
